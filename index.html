Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this assignment is to develop skills in using <canvas> elements, to be used in further diagnostic apps. 
 
Known Issues:
- Footer was overlapping with content at bottom, such as rectangle and button. User is unable to click the button as a result.
- On laptop, Draw rectangle button appears adjacent to canvas instead of under.
