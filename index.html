Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this assignment is to develop skills in using <canvas> elements, to be used in further diagnostic apps. 
 
Known Issues:
1. Footer was overlapping with content at bottom, such as rectangle and button. User is unable to click the button as a result. (resolved -- moved content to top of screen)
2. On laptop, Draw rectangle button appears adjacent to canvas instead of under. (resolved -- put buttons in flex-container with vertical direction)
3. Need to redeclare var a_canvas and a_context within each function: not working when these vars are global. (resolved -- this is a correct way)

/**
In the script section of our code, we define all the drawing functions that will need to be called by the buttons. Each of the four actions requires its own function. 

For each function, we declare a_canvas as the variable calling the canvas in question ("a"). This means that the function can only be used for canvas a, none other.
	(If we wanted to use the same function for multiple different canvases, we would need to structure the function so that it accepts a parameter for the method .getElementByID().
	This parameter would identify which canvas we want the function to use.)	
We define the context for our canvas as "2d", since we are making 2d drawings only. 3d is not possible. 

Breakdown of eath function:

draw_a() is responsible for drawing a rectangle on the canvas. 
	I used .fillStyle method to make an orange drawing.
	I used .fillRect method to make a rectangle shaped drawing. This method accepts four parameters: (upper left x coordinate, upper left y coordinate, x length, y length).

name_a() is responsible for printing my name on the canvas.
	I used .fillStyle method to make a black drawing.
	I used .textAlign method to make the drawing align to the center of the canvas.
	I used .textBaseline method to anchor the text to the middle of the line.
	I used .fillText method to draw text. This method accepts three parameters: (desired text, upper left x coordinate, upper left y coordinate).
	
image_a() is responsible for showing an image on the canvas.
	For this method, the image must first be instantiated using the Image() constructor.
	Then, the source of the image must be defined using the src attribute.
	Then, the .onload event method must be called on the image to retrieve it from its source. 
	This event can call a nested function to actually draw the image on the canvas using the drawImage() method.
	I used drawImage() method that accepts five parameters: (image name, upper left x coordinate, upper left y coordinate, x scale length, y scale length).

clear_a() is responsible for clearing the canvas.
	I used .width method to reset the width to itself. This effectivey clears the canvas of any content and restores the default settings of the canvas.

/**
Commentary on Known Issue 3
I was confused about why we would not declare a_canvas and a_context as global variables, like below: 

const a_canvas = document.getElementById("a");
const a_context = a_canvas.getContext("2d");
The reason is because the HTML doesn't get loaded until after script runs, so there is no element titled "a", so the functions are not defined.

function draw_a() {
	var a_canvas = document.getElementById("a");
	var a_context = a_canvas.getContext("2d");
	a_context.fillStyle = "orange";
	a_context.fillRect(50, 25, 150, 250);
}
	
function name_a() {
	var a_canvas = document.getElementById("a");
	var a_context = a_canvas.getContext("2d");
	a_context.fillStyle = "black";
	a_context.textAlign = "center";
	a_context.textBaseline = "middle";
	a_context.fillText("Neha Yawalkar", 125, 75);
	
}
	
function image_a() {
	var a_canvas = document.getElementById("a");
	var a_context = a_canvas.getContext("2d");
	var img = new Image();
	img.src ="https://brand.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Athletics_Bevo_Silhouette.svg";
	img.onload = function() {
		a_context.drawImage(img, 50, 125, 150, 100);
	}	
}
	
function clear_a() {
	var a_canvas = document.getElementById("a");
	var a_context = a_canvas.getContext("2d");
	a_canvas.width = a_canvas.width;
